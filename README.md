# LinguaScribe - AI Story Generator

This is a Next.js application called LinguaScribe that allows you to generate short stories in different languages, along with accompanying images, using AI.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, install the project dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

## How to Use LinguaScribe

Once the development server is running:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002`.
2.  You'll see the LinguaScribe interface.
3.  Use the form to:
    *   Select a **Language** for your story.
    *   Choose the **Language Level** (e.g., A1, B2).
    *   Pick a **Story Topic** from the presets or enter a custom topic.
4.  Click the "Generate Story" button.
5.  The AI will generate a short story in the selected language, an English translation, and an illustrative image.
6.  You can use the audio player to listen to the story in the generated language.
